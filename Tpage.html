                 <h1>How did He Die?</h1>
                 <p>On 14 June 2020, Rajput, aged 34, was found dead, hanging
                    from the ceiling fan in his home in Bandra, Mumbai.
                     He had reportedly shown signs of clinical
                     depression and was suffering from bipolar disorder.
                      The Mumbai Police commenced an
                      investigation, stating that the death was being 
                      treated as a suicide. The postmortem report stated 
                      that the cause of death was "asphyxia due to hanging,"
                       and called it a "clear case of suicide." 
                      The autopsy doctors placed the time of death at 10 to 
                      12 hours before postmortem examination on 14 June at 11:30 
                      p.m.—meaning between 11:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. (Indian Standard Time). 
                      No foul play was found. The viscera report likewise ruled out foul 
                      play. On 25 July, Rajput's family lodged a first information report with police in Patna, 
                      where his father lives, accusing Rhea Chakraborty and five others of abetment of suicide.</p>
